# Proposal: Final Course Project

6/7/19 Update
## Assignment 10 - SEO and Analytics
On my site I plan to use SEO best practices for page content, such as headers, paragraphs, images and URLs. These are simple techniques that any web page author can implement.

The techniques discussed here all make for a better user experience. In the past, people tried SEO techniques that tried to "game" the system. Most of those don't work anymore. The techniques in this post improve both the user experience and SEO.

Here are some highlights:

* The first paragraph of content is very important
   Google uses these for "snippets," which are the answers you read directly on the Google search result page
   If your page is a "featured snippet" on Google, you'll get lots of web traffic
* Images are also very important
   When other websites use images from your website and link back to your website, your Google ranking improves
   Host images on your domain (e.g., homepage.com/images), not on some other server
* Use short URLs readable by humans

   Don't use: reviews.best-online-tools.info/oldseqs?ID=17&tabdetail=3498UTM=345A34sd

* Another option for API data: [Zillow Real Estate Data](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm)

For my portfolio project, I plan to use data from the City of Seattle [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/). The data set I plan to use at this time is the [Fremont Bridge Hourly Bicycle Counts](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k). However, I have not finalized my choice of data set. As the quarter progresses and I learn more about data sets, APIs, and the Vue framework, I will continue to evaluate the various data sets available on the City portal. I will make my final choice depending on both my evolving technical skills and the specific data available.


## Project Objectives

* Learn how to build a website and connect it to an API data set
* Make City of Seattle data available in a manner that the average web user can understand
* Create a website suitable for my portfolio
