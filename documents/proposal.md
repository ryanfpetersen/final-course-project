# Proposal: Final Course Project

For my portfolio project, I plan to use data from the City of Seattle [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/). The data set I plan to use at this time is the [Fremont Bridge Hourly Bicycle Counts](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k). However, I have not finalized my choice of data set. As the quarter progresses and I learn more about data sets, APIs, and the Vue framework, I will continue to evaluate the various data sets available on the City portal. I will make my final choice depending on both my evolving technical skills and the specific data available.

## Project Objectives

* Learn how to build a website and connect it to an API data set
* Make City of Seattle data available in a manner that the average web user can understand
* Create a website suitable for my portfolio
